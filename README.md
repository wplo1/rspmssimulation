# rspmssimulation

Code runs simulations for the data-generating mechanism where both RM and RS (as defined in Proposition 2.3) are low, in the case of a Normal surrogate endpoint and linear logit link for true endpoint, such that the range of surrogate values in the control arm lies within the range of surrogate values in the treatment arm (subsetted supports), under equal allocation (r=1) and a sample size of 200 per arm (total sample size 400).

The results correspond to the first two rows of Table 2.8 (point estimates of performance measures) and the first two rows of Table B.4 (Monte Carlo standard errors of performance measures; Appendix B) in my thesis.
